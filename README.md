# LogoMaker

## Description

This Logo Maker is a command-line application built with Node.js that takes user input to generate a logo and save it on an SVG file. The user can select colour , shape and provide text for the logo. Once saved, a logo will be generated into an .svg file. As an aspiring web developer, I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so, I do not have to pay a graphic designer.
